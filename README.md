## What's git?
Gist is a VCS, which is different from others, such as cvs, svn, git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.  Excerpt from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
